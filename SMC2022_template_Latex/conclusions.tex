A test setup has been developed based on the current methods used at CHBC, a system design was created, and a Fruit Ninja-Inspired play audiometer was designed and implemented to be controlled by the Azure Kinect. The audiologist generally found the new methods appealing and could see the potential; however, several issues were pointed out, such as distracting graphics when presenting tones and gameplay being too long. This indicates the prototype needs further implementation before testing on the target group. Solving these issues should help avoid problems in further iterations. Nevertheless, when testing on children, it is essential to assess whether (1) the visuals are too distracting and need to be toned down, (2) the gameplay distracts the child from the hearing test, and (3) whether delay and tracking issues with the Azure Kinect can be kept to a minimum when tracking the children.
