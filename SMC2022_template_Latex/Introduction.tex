\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates over 34 million kids worldwide have hearing loss severe enough to require rehabilitation \cite{WHO}. Early detection of hearing loss is a crucial factor when it comes to restoring speech development \cite{ipadAudiometry, self-administeredHL, warbleTonesComparison}. For assessing whether a person's hearing is impaired, pure tone audiometry in a sound booth is often used to measure hearing thresholds \cite{self-administeredHL} and is considered the "gold" standard of audiological examination \cite{GoldStandard}. Both air conduction and bone conduction thresholds can be measured in a pure-tone hearing test \cite{GoldStandard}. Air conduction is measured using headphones with pure tones ranging from 0.125 kHz to 8 kHz, while bone conduction is measured using an oscillator on a head-band with frequencies ranging from 0.25 kHz to 4 kHz \cite{GoldStandard}. The pure-tone signals are delivered to the patient using an audiometer, and if the signal is perceived, the patient is asked to raise a hand or press a button \cite{RaiseHand}.  \newline

Normal pure-tone audiometry can be used for individuals six years or older \cite{CFBH}; however, for children in the age range of 3-5 years old, a modification of the standard pure-tone audiometry is used called Conditioned Play Audiometry (CPA) \cite{CFBH}. As the name implies, CPA turns the hearing test into a game. Several types of games can be used, but the essential part is that the child will react by, e.g., putting a toy in a box when a sound is perceived. The child must understand the game before testing; therefore, the same tone will be played until the audiologist is sure the game is understood \cite{CFBH}. It is not easy to keep children's attention, especially when they are used to playing with technology at home (i.e., using phones, tablets, etc.). Generally, CPA suffers from poor patient cooperation \cite{ipadAudiometry}. In a conversation with Lone Percy-Smith, project leader at the Copenhagen Hearing and Balance Centre (CHBC)\footnote{Copenhagen Hearing and Balance Centre: https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/afdelinger-og-klinikker/hovedorto/oere-naese-halskirurgi/enheder-og-laboratorier/Sider/center-for-hoerelse-og-balance.aspx}, it was mentioned that up to one of every third hearing test using CPA, ends up with little to no results from the CPA, as the children do not engage with the hearing test \cite{loneConversation}.  Transferring CPA methods to a computer game could help keep the child engaged while automating the analog process to address low patient cooperation \cite{ipadAudiometry}. \newline

Many young children refuse to wear headphones for threshold measurements, so free-field (i.e., using speakers instead of headphones) is often used \cite{WarbleTonesBook1}. However, free-field measurements are not as precise as when wearing headphones \cite{warbleTonesComparison}. Using free-field to play a pure tone might cause reflections from the boundaries in the test room \cite{warbleTonesComparison}. These reflections may result in standing waves when meeting the wave from the source  \cite{WarbleTonesBook1}. The combination of the two waves will cause interference, and depending on the wave's displacement, they can either add together or cancel each other out. \cite{WarbleTonesBook1}. The affected frequencies and the severity of the problem will depend upon the specific room acoustics \cite{warbleTonesComparison}. To resolve this problem, warble tones are used and are especially advocated when measuring hearing thresholds in children \cite{warbleTonesComparison}. Warble tones are frequency-modulated tones, meaning it is a periodic modification of a center frequency. The periodic modification will cause a variation of the base frequency with values either above or below the center frequency \cite{warbleTonesComparison}. Beside the center frequency, the warble tone has a frequency deviation (measured percentage deviating from the center frequency) and a modulation rate (measured in Hz) \cite{warbleTonesComparison, WarbleTonesBook1}. The frequency deviation and the modulation rate are what create the warbling sensation \cite{warbleTonesComparison}. \newline

This paper explores the potential of turning CPA into playful gamification to address issues of low patient cooperation by creating a fun play audiometer. An engaging 3D game will be implemented, where an Azure Kinect\footnote{Azure Kinect: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/azure-kinect-dk/8pp5vxmd9nhq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab} is used to detect the child's reactions to sound automatic (read more in section \ref{kinect}).
